module: expr
short_description: Evaluate python expressions.
description:
  - When you prevent functionality, someone will find a way around it.
    The M(expr) action allows use of C(eval()) to evaluate expressions
    and use of C(exec()) to execute statements.

options:

  eval:
    description:
      - Evaluate the expression. Runs C(eval()) on the provided
        expression. C(eval()) is provided the current set of Ansible
        variables. The resulting value is available from the I(eval) key
        from the registered result.
      - Traceback information will be printed on error when verbose mode
        is set to "-vv" or higher.
    required: false

  exec:
    description:
      - Executes the statements. Runs C(exec()) on the provided
        statements. C(exec()) is provided the current set of Ansible
        variables. The resulting value is available from the I(exec) key
        from the registered result.
      - This requires I(returns) to be set.
      - Traceback information will be printed on error when verbose mode
        is set to "-vv" or higher.
    required: false

  imports:
    description:
      - Import the specified modules and expose them for use within
        I(eval) or I(exec). This can be either a single string or a list
        of strings containing import statements. Multiple import
        statements on a single line can be separated by a semi-colon
        C(";") for terseness. Import statements are in the form
        C([import] ...) or C([from] ... import ...) where C([import])
        and C([from]) are optional.
    required: false

  returns:
    description:
      - The values to return from the execution. This is evaluated as an
        expression.
      - This is required by I(exec).
      - This is not applicable to I(eval).
    required: false

  vars:
    description:
      - Any additional variables to expose for use within I(eval) or
        I(exec). This must be a dictionary.
    required: false
